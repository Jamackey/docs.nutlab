To measure the speed of airsoft bb's, two light gates are spaced a set distance away from eachother. A microcontroller is used to calculate the time it takes for a bb to pass each point and calculates the speed in m/s or fps.</p> <p>For more information, click here!</p>"},{"location":"projects/","title":"Nutlab projects","text":"<p>In Nutlabs we like to create software and hardware to solve everyday problems and challenge our brains.
